    <h2>My group and I coded a python that represented the cycle of dawn to dusk or in other words day and night.</h2>
    <h2>Our program had a scenery as shown above and the sun would move across the sky and once it reaches the edge,</h2>
    <h2>the sky becomes night and the moon appears replacing the sun. This would move across the screen once again</h2>
    <h2>and returns to a sun. This cycle repeats in an infinite loop to represent how a new day will always come.</h2>
    <h2>In this project I was responsible for the creation of the codes for the background sky and house while also</h2>
    <h2>managing the speed of the motion in which the sun and moon moves and also the placement of where the sun and</h2>
    <h2>moon will appear each time the cycle repeats itself. When we faced problems during coding I was responsible for</h2>
    <h2>going over the codes and finding the problem and notifying the group so that we could find the solution together.</h2>

    <h1>This is my second project "I Made this up on the Fly"</h1>

    <h2>Our group created a game where we click the fly and it turns into a troll face to indicate that it was squished.</h2>
    <h2>Once the fly is squished, two random numbers from 0 to 100(num1 and num2)are chosen and an equation of num1 + num2</h2>
    <h2>is formed and if we answer this equation correctly, a point is added to the score count and if it is incorrect, it</h2>
    <h2>doesn't show up on the score board but keeps track of how many the player missed. Continue this until the time limit</h2>
    <h2>of 30 seconds runs out. At the end, it shows you the score of how many questions the player got correct out of the </h2>
    <h2>total amount of questions the player got.</h2>
