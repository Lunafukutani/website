    <h2>My group and I coded a python that represented the cycle of dawn to dusk or in other words day and night.</h2>
    <h2>Our program had a scenery as shown above and the sun would move across the sky and once it reaches the edge,</h2>
    <h2>the sky becomes night and the moon appears replacing the sun and it would move across the screen once again</h2>
    <h2>and become a sun this cycle repeats in an infinite loop just to represent how a new day will always come.</h2>
    <h2>In this project I was responsible for the creation of the codes for the background sky and house while also</h2>
    <h2>managing the speed of the motion in which the sun and moon moves and also the placement of where the sun and</h2>
    <h2>moon will appear each time the cycle repeats itself. When we faced problems during coding I was responsible for</h2>
    <h2>going over the codes and finding the problem and notifying the group so that we could find the solution together.</h2>
